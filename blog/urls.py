(?P<pk>\d+) â€“ this part is trickier. It means that Django will take
everything that you place here and transfer it to a view as a variable called
pk. (Note that this matches the name we gave the primary key variable back in
blog/templates/blog/post_list.html!) \d also tells us that it can only be a
digit, not a letter (so everything between 0 and 9). + means that there needs
to be one or more digits there. So something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/post//
is not valid, but http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/1234567890/ is perfectly OK!
